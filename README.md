PyPoll Project - 2019
------------------------
PyPoll is a Python script that analyzes the votes for a small 
community election.

The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID," "County,"
and "Candidate."
-------------------------
Using Python I calculated the following:

- Total number of votes cast.

- A complete list of candidates who received votes.

- The percentage of votes each candidate won.

- The total numberof votes each candidate won.

- The winner of the election based on popular vote.

- Prints analysis to terminal and exports a text file with results.
